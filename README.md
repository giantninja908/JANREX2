### purpose

this client aims to be an ACTUAL client, that can fundementally interface with krunker like the normal browser equivalent

# compiling

we reccomend using RUSTUP for a rust installation, and a simple `cargo run` is enough to be up and running
you require a CMAKE installation for raylib, a dependancy used for graphics

# contributing

I'll accept most pull reqs, please don't just make issues without potential solutions
